Description: Simple interactive helper tools for DM-ing an 
 AD&D second edition game  This is a simple set of tools for 
 dungeon managers. The current project only targets AD&D 2nd edition rules. 
 This is not an RPG game, it's some helper tools for people DM-ing real
 games and designed to not get in the way of role-play and story-telling
 but simply help to do the maths during encounters and levelling.
 Dice rolling can be done by the computer or the tools can be set for
 manual dice, in which case you simply enter the results of the roll.
