This is a simple set of commandline tools for dungeon managers.
The current project only targets AD&D 2nd edition rules.

This is not an RPG game, it's some helper tools for people DM-ing real
games and designed to not get in the way of role-play and story-telling
but simply help to do the maths during encounters and levelling.

All game data, charts and character sheets are stored in json format. 
There is a simple tool for creating and updating character sheets which
uses a powerful templateing engine to manage them, when new keys are added
to character sheets, simply add them to the template and load the sheets in with
mkcs to ensure the key is in existing sheets.

Template controls:
Keys or values which start __? are controls.
The __? parts are not stored in the output sheets, they only exist in the template
to tell the engine how to use the key.
Key controls:
	__U - store the value of this key in upper-case
	__L - store the value of this key in lower-case
	__# - This is used to create subdictionary items with variable number of entries
	      a __# key has a single dictionary in the template showing the subdictionary structure
	      this subdictionary can use any template controls as well. The template engine will let
              the user select how many subdictionaries to create, and populate these by using the subtemplate in the value
Value controls:
__[?,?]
	Value must be selected from the options in the list between the []'s
