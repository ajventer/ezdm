This is a simple set of tools for dungeon managers with a simple browser-based interface
The current project only targets AD&D 2nd edition rules.

If you're looking for a prebuilt debian package, I maintain an EZDM PPA
at: https://launchpad.net/~ajventer/+archive/ezdm/

Branches: 
        - Master is in flux - at any given moment, it may not build or run
        - Stable is merged whenever master appears not to be broken
        - All others are feature branches

This is not an RPG game, it's some helper tools for people DM-ing table-top
games and designed to not get in the way of role-play and story-telling
but simply help to do the maths during encounters and levelling.
Dice rolling can be done by the computer or the tools can be set for
manual dice, in which case you simply enter the results of the roll.

All game data, charts and character sheets are stored in json format. 
There is a simple tool for creating and updating character sheets which
uses a powerful templateing engine to manage them, when new keys are added
to character sheets, simply add them to the template and load the sheets in with
mkcs to ensure the key is in existing sheets.


Combat is the crown jewel of the EZDM kit. Combat will let you load up any number of characters
from your existing sheets, and will then guide the process of combat among them under your control.
As the DM you decide who the NPCs attack, you tell the story represented by the information that quickcombat
presents to you. QuickCombat ensures the right sized dice are rolled at the right time, the right saving throws
and modifiers are applied, the right damage recorded etc.
Quick-Combat deals with melee and misile factors, spell-casting and interruptions (including informing you when a spell is finished)
and generically divides spells into heal, damage or other. You tell it what to handle (or what you will be handling yourself), and it 
enables you without getting in your way.
That is the core design goal of the entire EZDM suite - to enable your storytelling while making it easier to follow the rules
and doing the math for you, but without EVER getting in your way.
I wrote EZDM to help with DM-ing my own campaigns - but I hope it may be useful to others, hence it is published here on github.



Template controls:
Keys or values which start __? are controls.
The __? parts are not stored in the output sheets, they only exist in the template
to tell the engine how to use the key.
Key controls:
	__U - store the value of this key in upper-case
	__L - store the value of this key in lower-case
	__# - This is used to create subdictionary items with variable number of entries
	      a __# key has a single dictionary in the template showing the subdictionary structure
	      this subdictionary can use any template controls as well. The template engine will let
              the user select how many subdictionaries to create, and populate these by using the subtemplate in the value
Value controls:
__[?,?]
	Value must be selected from the options in the list between the []'s
